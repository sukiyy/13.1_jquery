# 13.1_jquery

jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to make DOM manipulation more accessible and less tedious. It's very user-friendly! jQuery was once the most popular JavaScript library and is still used at three out of every four companies doing work in JavaScript. There's tons of documentation for jQuery beyond what we're going to teach you in this subunit, and we encourage you to explore some of the fun animations and other features of this library on your own time. 

 

There will be two exercises at the end of this subunit. In the first, you'll get some practice using jQuery for DOM manipulation. In the second, you'll make a lightweight app to add your favorite movies (and a few stinkers) to sortable list.
